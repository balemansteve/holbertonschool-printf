Collaborative project "C - printf" for Holberton

1)	Description.
In this project we create a function that emulates part of the behavior of the printf function in the C programming language.
The function must be able to interpret and display text in the console based on the provided arguments.


	The printf syntax is as follows:

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

format: It is a string of characters that specifies the output format.
...: Represents the variable arguments to be printed according to the placeholder.


2)	Functions.
Handling of the following placeholders:
%c: to print a character.
%s: to print character strings.
%i: to print signed integers.
%%: to print a character %.
Support string formats and additional arguments.
When compiled and executed correctly, the function showld return the number of characters printed.
